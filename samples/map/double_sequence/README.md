**double_sequence**

This example implements the computation of an output sequence whose values are the double of the input sequence.

The program first creates two vectors with a size given by the user. One of the vectors is filled with sequentially increasing values.

Then the map pattern is used to fill in parallel the second vector with the values of the first vector multiplied by two.
